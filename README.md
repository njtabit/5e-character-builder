# 5e-character-builder

WIP Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition character builder web app.

I am using this project both to learn React and showcase that knowledge.

## Credits
The state/reducer framework was written using React Hooks by Saturnaut

Dungeons & Dragons belongs to Wizards of the Coast.

The game information JSON files come from 5etools.com

This project was inspired by More Purple More Better's auto-fill D&D character sheets
